  <h1>ABOUT</h1>

  <p>Bits & Bytes actively designs for sound, voice, gesture, movement and touch-based experiences over visual
  interfaces. We prioritize the multi-sensory experiences in our approach to designing intelligent interfaces
  and agents. Members of Bits & Bytes engage in collaborative making in physical and digital spaces:
  (1) digitally through Facebook, Meet-ups, E-mail, Instagram, text messages and Internet Protests;
  (2) physically through community partnerships such as Women Who Code, the Women’s Center for Creative Work,
  the Altadena Public Library, and Machine Project. Our goal is to to create alternatives to hegemonic AI creation.
  Feminist AI Projects pays homage to the writings and research produced by Alison Adam’s Feminist AI Projects,
  and to embodiment and emotion research from Dara Blumenthal, Katherine Hayles and Sara Ahmed.</p>

  <p>Bits & Bytes reflects the spirit of the open source movement, and a secondary goal of this project is to use
  open source methods to create new thinking around designing for artificial intelligence. Our making approach
  is not only collaborative in person, but also in idea generation. We are inspired not only by surrealist
  methods of picture variation known as “exquisite corpse,” but also of extending beyond pictures to concepts,
  materials and protest techniques. The highlighted feminist projects explore the methods, approach, research
  and creations of embodied interconnected intelligences that emerge and materially transform as imagined and
  created in our collaborative making.</p>

  <p>This project emerges from a MFA thesis in Media Design Practices at ArtCenter College of Design. This work examines the design implications of a Feminist Artificial Intelligence while considering the following design questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How can we co-author designs for embodiment in AI?</li>
    <li>How can we call attention to the disembodiment of the female in AI models?</li>
    <li>How can we incorporate cultural and social considerations in our AI design tools?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Thesis Statement for this argument</h3>
 <!--  <%= image_tag("about_feminist-artificial-intelligence_vive.jpg", alt: "Edit Entry", class:'images') %> -->
  <p>Early explorations of symbolic Artificial Intelligence, relying on the
  Turing Test, focused on methods to create a disembodied mind. Currently, the
  popular Artificial Neural Network computational model is based on biological
  neural networks in the human brain. However, both models still prioritize
  cognitive-sensory information and fail to account for the lived, social and
  cultural experiences of embodiment. This disembodiment is prevalent in AI
  development environments, which are overwhelmingly male, and the conceptual
  and physical designs of these systems often employ a highly sexualized or
  disembodied female form, implemented as an assistant or caretaker. This is
  evidenced in across various media including Japanese Manga, comics, popular
  films, AI dolls, and home and mobile smart devices.</p>

  <p>Feminist theorists Alison Adam and Katherine Hayles posit that Artificial
  Intelligence should focus on addressing embodiment in the design and
  development of AI systems. Dara Blumenthal and Sara Ahmed consider embodiment
  to extend beyond the boundaries of the body, through the body-self, which they
  consider to be living, indefinite, and a mixture of bodily sensations,
  emotions, and thoughts, with the ability to shape the surfaces of individual
  and collective bodies. This approach expands on their ideas of embodiment in
  that rather than being confined to a body, we can understand the collective
  experience of fluid bodies formed by cultural emotions, while reflecting on
  Blumenthal's idea of embodiment beyond the enfleshed.</p>

  <h3>My response to hegemonic AI is through making</h3>
<!--   <%= image_tag("about_feminist-artificial-intelligence_home_about_posthuman.jpg", alt: "Edit Entry", class:'images') %> -->
  <p>These feminist AI projects explore design implications when making from a
  collaborative, feminist, post-human perspective. These two Feminist AI
  projects, the Post-human Plugin and Collaborative AI, explore a situated,
  re-embodiment of AI, from an experiential multi-sensory perspective while
  addressing social, cultural, material and post-human elements of embodiment.
  Collaborative AI is a direct response to the lack of women in AI development
  and brings multiple voices into AI creation through co-authoring. Post-human
  Plugin is a making response to the disembodiment of the female form in a
  household AI system, Alexa.</p>
