  <h1>RESEARCH METHODS: Sensory Socicultural Embodiment</h1>

  <p>Our approach to knowledge affects the way we design for intelligence and information within intelligent systems.
  In the design workshops, we incorporated body knowledge as a basis for designing for embodiment in AI prototypes.
  Designing for embodiment, we referenced research from Sara Ahmed, Katherine Hayles and Dara Blumenthal with the
  following points in mind:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Embodiment extends beyond the body and can include the cultural and social shaping of embodied experiences.</li>
    <li>Individual and cultural emotional experiences are subjective and embodied.</li>
    <li>Emotions, cognition, and sensations are interconnected and are often indistinguishable.</li>
    <li>The affective economies of smiling and tone of voice should be highlighted or challenged</li>
    <li>We can use our bodies and AI design to boycott the affective economies created by social spaces by addressing smile and tone.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If emotions and embodiment extend beyond the human, how can this affect designing for embodiment in AI systems?
 CAN WE MAKE THIS A BLOCK QUOTE?</p>

  <h2>Facial Expressions</h2>
  <p>We studied non-verbal communication through facial expressions, specifically smiling. The following explores
  background, research questions and </p>

  <p>What is the role of a smile? On her blog Feminist Killjoys, Sara Ahmed writes about smiles.
  She highlights the connection between smiling and perceived happiness. She also highlights
  the role of smiling as a socially imposed and potentially violent behavior. In our workshops,
  we discussed the social and cultural experiences of smiling. We drew from Ahmed's main points
  . Some of the things we discussed were: Smile as performance, Smile as employed and Smile as defense of
  extreme exploitation.

  <p>Our discussion about the social and cultural expectations placed on women
  through the form of smiling resulted in questions like:
  <ul>
    <li>Where do you feel a smile in your body?</li>
    <li>What is the difference between an imposed smile and a genuine smile? (which in our discussion is different than a fake and real smile.)</li>
    <li>Do you want your smiles captured?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There was an overall feeling that society imposes smiles. Workshop attendees claimed they only wanted certain
  people and designated organizations to have the ability to receive or capture their smiles. With the rise in emotions analytics employed through computer vision,
  voice analysis, body movement, what does it mean to capture a socially or culturally imposed smile? This lead to to larger discussions within our group.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Participants associated smiling with being friendly, natural, bonding,
      and reading love and joy, an indicate of interest.
    </li>
    <li>
      Participants acknowledge that there is a difference between “real” and
      “fake” smiles.
    </li>
    <li>
      Participants reported that real smiles come from laughing, happiness,
      the eyes, inspiration, are genuine, and emerge from a feeling.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fake smiles are associated with being preoccupied, not feeling real joy,
      church, as a form of acknowledgment, to mask the feeling of
      wanting to cry, as a way to deal with someone you dislike, to be polite, and
      to engage with co-workers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Reports of situations where one feels like she has to smile include:
      when working, in professional settings, and meeting people you dislike.
    </li>

    <li>
      Respondents reported being told to smile when getting a picture taken,
      or at a social event.
    </li>

    <li>
      Participants reported the bodily location of a smile: in the cheeks,
      stomach, chest, head, and mind.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>

<!--   <%= image_tag 'feminist-artificial-intelligence_design-research_findings.jpg', alt:'', class:'images' %> -->
  <p>The research indicates that while the participants
  were critical of the smile in conversation, there is still a regard for the
  smile and an honoring of different types of smiles. The selective capturing of
  smiles stood out as a main point, as well as the ability to send neutral
  smiles via social media (through things like emojis or thumbs up), without
  having to smile, felt more sincere than a physically fake smile.
  </p>

<h4>TONE OF VOICE</h4>
  <p>We discussed nonverbal communication through the perceived "tone" of voices.
  During our conversations the following points regarding the affective economy of tone emerged.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Participants were told to change their tone or to "get a gentler one" when they are
      considered to loud or aggressive, or complaining.</li>
      <li>Participants noticed their tone changing with specific people and specific encounters
      as evidenced by "Stress makes my tone grow sharp and high pitched", and "When I'm genuine,
      my tone is more relaxed and when I'm in formal situations I tend to sound hyper, like I
      want people to know that I'm genuinely interested in them".</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Both vocal fry (creak voice) and upspeak (rising inflection) are slowly changing the way we
    communicate as speech patterns are modeled to us via popular media as well as through commercial
    AI products like chatbots, Alexa, Siri, and RealDolls.</p>

    <p>This <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz8lvCqH2p96MHJvd0twV2dTX3M">Voice Design Toolkit</a>
    titled Posthuman Plugin, further explores the relationship between the affective economy of tone and
    emerging trends in conversational user interface. This toolkit was created by conversations with
    women in (and outside of) the Bits and Bytes workshops and addresses the gender and humanization
    of voice in commercial AI. The toolkit playfully explores how we might change the material of the
    voice through natural and man made items, like metal, cities, and plants. Additional conversations
    about emotionally responsive conversational user interfaces (CUI) resulted in a significant divide
    between those who desired an emotionally responsive CUI (about 50%), and those who had no desire
    for an emotionally responsive CUI.</p>


  <h2>MOVEMENT</h2>

      <p>We discussed the emotions associated with movement, individually and collectively.</p>

  <ul>
   <li>A recognition that moving in a group introduced new noises and experiences.</li>
    <li>An awareness of behavior changing when entering a new environment, or encountering a person or object.
    The reports in these feelings changed significantly when the participants were blindfolded on the last
    sensory walk. When people were blindfolded they noticed the texture and slope of the ground and reported
    feeling safe when engaged in a tactile and/or spatial relationship with another person.</li>
    <li>Sensations are not considered separately, but are tied to other each other. The combination of multiple
    sensations creates the experience. This was most obvious when sensory experiences contradict each other:
    "The smell downtown is really strong. It smells like garbage and stale air. The visuals contradict the
    smell when I look up at the big buildings. When I look down and witness the garbage it makes sense."
    Another example of multi-sensory experiences was when a participant "notice the cold less", when she saw people.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>EMOTION</h2>

   <p>We discussed our comfort level with emotions analytics, along with the role of emotion in our sensory-embodied
   experiences. We discussed the emotions associated with movement, individually and collectively.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A belief that there is a relationship between perceived mood and sensations: "My mood is definitely tied
    to the images I take in".</li>
    <li>A belief that different senses are heightened in emotional situations.</li>
    <li>Sensory-Emotional experiences can be triggered by external stimuli: "Sound also is a sense that can trigger emotions for me.
    Music, the sound of nature, all evoke positive emotions."</li>
    <li>TIt was suggested that materials and techniques are contextual and mood specific: "As far as my personal art work,
    my materials and techniques change depending on my mood." This observation speaks to the idea of contextual sensory
    responsiveness, while at the same time addresses the materiality of an input.</li>
  </ul>

 <h3>AI CONCEPT RESEARCH</h3>
 <h4>#1 AI MODEL MAKING</h4>

  <p>I approached AI model creation via different research paths. I used Twitter, a self-created toolkit, and verbal
  interviews as my three forms of information collection. I then took the responses from each section and asked
  participants to vote on their top three preferences. Of the thirty-three responses, I took the top four to give the
  Bits and Bytes more resources to draw from. The top four responses came from all three categorizes, with two from Twitter.</p>


  <h5>#1 TWITTER</h5>
   <p>The question prompted people through facebook and email to participate in Bits and Bytes twitter research.
   There were a series of questions, the final one asking participants how they would use an AI agent, and were
   requested to respond with the hashtag #bitsbytesLA7.</p>

  <p>While I enjoy the idea of using twitter for research, there are several assumptions and challenges with this approach.
  There is an assumption that users twitter postings are public. Many people participated but their responses were not seen
  due to their privacy settings. Additionally, the question itself assumes some familiarity with the concept of AI agents.
  For this demographic using twitter was acceptable, as it was an interesting way to collect data, and there were some
  interesting responses, however, twitter has decreased in popularity and would not be a great option for long-term research
  opportunities. Example responses:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>#bitsbytesLA7 can an AI agent turn OFF ads in the physical space (eg no more digital billboards!)?</li>
    <li>#bitsbytesLA7 I would like to use Natural Language Processing with the Anonymity software I want to build to help rape survivors.</li>
    <li>#bitsbytesLA7 An autonomous car that give me the best recommendations for my days/evening. For instance, the best shows or restaurants.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>#2 AI TOOLKIT</h5>
  <p>This <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz8lvCqH2p96dXVRTTFDNFlJYVU">AI toolkit</a> is a downloadable PDF for
  anyone to create their own AI Model. The kit provides examples of a what it would mean to design with a material form, data,
  rulesets and behaviors. The goal in taking a broad, less technical approach to model making was to get individuals to think
  outside of traditional human-focused ideas about intelligence, and incorporate other non-human ways of designing with AI,
  while at the same time tackling social concerns. While this might not be completely AI accurate, it was an effective tool
  to get people to think about alternative ways to design. These models were created with women in Los Angeles and Washington DC.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>SUBVERTING SURVEILLANCE: Subverting Surveillance is a community policing model that tracks and surveils police
    to hold them accountable and prevent police brutality.</li>
    <li>HERBAL HEALTH: Plants that can be self sufficient and learn from health data using search engines to help create hybrids to help ailments.</li>
    <li>THE NEW LANGUAGE OF EMOTION: Create a new language of emotion and use it to protest (digitally and physically) throughout the city.
    The city is constructed like a quilt, nodes in a network, or spider web, all with specific points of intersection, addressing one
    small part of the whole. Each person’s individual digital emotion and environmental profile would engage differently in each location,
    utilizing intentional physiological responses while at the same time exposing cultural bias in physical and digital spaces. This “city quilt”
    would change the profiles of people under the data quilt space, and the profiles of those under each section of quilt, could change
    that section of quilt. Outputs would be tactile, sonic and visual.</li>

  </ul>

  <h5>#3 PHONE INTERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS</h5>
  <p></p>

  <ul>
    <li>BANANAS: Animal intelligence or Insect intelligence. Picking out the best bananas for a monkey based on scent.</li>
    <li>EMOTION BAROMETER: Emotion barometer / tracker on the phone. So people can know how they are communicate with people.
    Would aggregate all the data for all the different users and would categorize ranges of emotion and categorize situations
    and give recommended behavioral actions or tactics for circumstances to help improve people's behavior.</li>
    <li>LANDSCAPE PAINTINGS: Wants to use nature intelligence to make paintings.</li>
  </ul>

   <h4>#2 DATA, VIDEO AND RULES </h4>
   <p>The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells,
   each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, or “populated” or “unpopulated”
   (the difference may seem minor, except when viewing it as an early model of human/urban behavior
   simulation or how one views a blank space on a grid). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors,
   which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. </p>

  <p>The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying
  the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed—births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the
  discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick. The rules continue to be applied
  repeatedly to create further generations.</p>

  <h5>Findings as materials:</h5>
  <p>18 AI models were proposed from the speech, twitter and an AI toolkit explorations. We asked the unheard voices of AI creation,
  across the United States, to contribute their thoughts about what would make an effective AI system.
  The top four votes / responses were pulled from our AI Ideas Survey. They are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Emotion Barometer</li>
      <li>Subverting Surveillance</li>
      <li>Real Time Ad Remover</li>
      <li>The New Language of Emotion</li>
    </ul>

  <p>Drawing from the top 4 responses, we focused on the themes of protest, surveillance, emotion,
  communication, body data and obfuscation. The overall connection with these systems is the ability
  to use our body data to protest, monitor, obfuscate or disable systems within our environment.
  Our making used the resultes of these mdoels to focus on how we might use our body data as protest,
  creating a space for everyone to project meaning into their own body protest space.</p>

  <p>The final result included using plant information and face movment to engage in a sound portest in both
  a physical and digital space.</p>

  <h4>Processing Conway’s Game of Life</h4>
  <p>rules retrieved from Wikipedia</p>

  <ul>
  <li>At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

  <li> Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by underpopulation.</li>

  <li> Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>

  <li> Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>

  <li> Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>What data will you use to create your rules? Here's an example of our process:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Take gender and salary. If salary is over $50,000 and female, fill in the cell. Play the game of life with a video. (Find a video that reflects your context). </li>

  <li>Repeat with gender reversed.</li>

  <li>Compare the two videos, open processing file, and add video. Write your ruleset in the comments.</li>

  <li>Use quick time recording to capture the process/li>

  </ul>

  <p>What might this look like using video Art?</p>
