  <h1>APPROACH</h1>

  <p>A recurring theme throughout my research was the fact that across the board, people have different understandings
  perspectives about AI. Some view commercial products, that utilize machine learning algorithms as AI, while others
  believe it can only exist in completely autonomous systems. Some participants in my research projects were intimidated
  about the technical complexity of AI, and were reluctant to discuss it out of fear of appearing ignorant or insecure.
  This means people with different knowledge systems might hesitate to contribute to the design, and reinforces this removal
  of people in the AI design process. This affected the way I engaged with participants in my design research workshops.
  In our workshops, we made the basic assumption that all approaches to AI are valid and to explore any ideas from the
  participants. The workshops produced an AI design tool, providing AI designers a way to design from a sociocultural
  perspective. Currently, AI designers assume industry standards in AI design, but this tool is a reminder to be critical
  of these assumptions.</p>

  <h2>AI Design Tool</h2>

  <p>Our design research findings indicate that users would like more transparency regarding the decisions and data in AI systems,
  and a recognition of biases within existing systems. This is a challenge for designers, as we need to recognize cultural and
  social assumptions and biases in AI designs.</p>

  <p>Many users reported a complete disconnect from algorithmic creation and AI design. The cultural AI design tool is an in browser
  generator that helps remove assumptions favoring a specific type of AI approach. It draws attention to the need to include cultural
  and social considerations in design, while at the same time offering a playful approach to AI design. Below is a rough
  sketch of the cultural design tool.</p>

    <h2>ADDITIONAL DESIGN APPROACHES EMERGED FROM THE WORKSHOPS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Design with and for the unheard voices in AI creation.</li>
      <li>AI design should be participatory in nature.</li>
      <li>All knowledge systems and skills should be equally honored and valued.</li>
      <li>Provide multiple entry points for user involvement, so as to incorporate differing knowledge systems and users.</li>
      <li>AI art projects can be a social response or technical making.</li>
    </ul>
