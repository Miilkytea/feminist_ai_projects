  <h2>Face sound protest:</h2>

  <p>This project pulled from the research created in the Bits and Bytes
  workshops. The participants wanted to "scream with their bodies" without using
  a voice. This resulted in a live Sound Face Protest at Machine Project. We
  used <a href="https://github.com/genekogan/ofxFaceTracker/">Gene Koganâ€™s ofxFaceTracker</a> as an input and tried two outputs,
  a midi board and <a href="http://www.wekinator.org/examples/#Pick_Choose_Outputs">FM Synth Processing Sketch</a>
  with the machine learning tool, <a href="http://www.wekinator.org/">Wekinator</a> existing artificial neural network model to curate our own algorithmic sound experiences</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Data: from our faces</li>
    <li>Input Type: continuous</li>
    <li>Learning: individually curated ML algorithms </li>
    <li>Model Type: neural network (with 1 hidden layer)</li>
    <li>Intent: protest</li>
    <li>Behavior: occupy with sound</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Posthuman plugin </h2>
  <p>The Posthuman Plugin examines the disembodiment of females through the re-appropriation of voice.</p>

  <p>Based on the voice toolkit, and verbal communication with people in Bits
  and Bytes, and interviews outside of Bits and Bytes, I took the top 3
  responses and created voice plugins to address the results of the
  research.</p>
