  <p>A recurring theme throughout my research was the fact that across the board, people have different understandings perspectives about AI. Some view commercial products, that utilize machine learning algorithms as AI, while others believe it can only exist in completely autonomous systems. Some participants in my research projects were intimidated about the technical complexity of AI, and were reluctant to discuss it out of fear of appearing ignorant or insecure. means people with different knowledge systems might hesitate to contribute to the design, and reinforces this removal of people in the AI design process. This affected the way I engaged with participants in my design research workshops. In our workshops, we made the basic assumption that all approaches to AI are valid and to explore any ideas from the participants.
    The workshops produced an AI design tool, providing AI designers a way to design from a socio sociocultural perspective. Currently, AI designers assume industry standards in AI design, but this tool is a reminder to be critical of these assumptions.

    <h4>ADDITIONAL DESIGN APPROACHES EMERGED FROM THE WORKSHOPS</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Design with and for the unheard voices in AI creation.</li>
    <li>AI design should be participatory in nature.</li>
    <li>All knowledge systems and skills should be equally honored and valued.</li>
    <li>Provide multiple entry points for user involvement, so as to incorporate differing knowledge systems and users.</li>
    <li>AI art projects can be a social response or technical making.</li>
    </ul>
