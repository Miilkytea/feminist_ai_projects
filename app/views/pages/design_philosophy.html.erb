  <p>
  Bits &#38; Bytes actively designs for sound, voice, gesture, movement and
  touch-based experiences over visual interfaces. We prioritize the
  multi-sensory experiences in our approach to designing intelligent interfaces
  and agents.  Members of Bits &#38; Bytes engage in collaborative making in
  physical and digital spaces: (1) digitally through Facebook, Meet-ups, E-mail,
  Instagram, text messages and Internet Protests; (2) physically through
  community partnerships such as Women Who Code, the Women’s Center for Creative
  Work, the Altadena Public Library, and Machine Project. Our goal is to to
  create alternatives to hegemonic AI creation. Feminist AI Projects pays homage
  to the writings and research produced by Alison Adam’s Feminist AI Projects,
  and to embodiment and emotion research from Dara Blumenthal, Katherine Hayles
  and Sara Ahmed.

  <p>
  Bits &#38; Bytes reflects the spirit of the open source movement, and a secondary
  goal of this project is to use open source methods to create new thinking
  around designing for artificial intelligence. Our making approach is not only
  collaborative in person, but also in idea generation. We are inspired not only
  by surrealist methods of picture variation known as “exquisite corpse,” but
  also of extending beyond pictures to concepts, materials and protest
  techniques. The highlighted feminist projects explore the methods, approach,
  research and creations of embodied interconnected intelligences that emerge
  and materially transform as imagined and created in our collaborative making.

    <h4>A specific design philosophy emerged from these workshops </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Design with and for the unheard voices and sounds in AI creation.</li>
      <li>We must be invited to a location to participate.</li>
      <li>All knowledge systems and skills are equally honored and valued.</li>
      <li>We want multiple entry points for involvement, so we can pull from different. knowledge systems for our design and development.</li>
      <li>The AI art project can be a social response or technical making.</li>
      <li>We would like to revisit every step of our process with every new project.</li>
